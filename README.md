## Tijaniyya Bibliographic Texts Database

This repository contains a structured bibliographic dataset of Tijaniyya texts in Nigeria developed as part of a master's research project on the database management of Sufi writings. The dataset was created to organize, preserve, and improve access to Tijaniyya books, manuscripts, and catalogs through a relational database approach.

The original records were compiled from documentary sources and transformed from unstructured Word documents into structured tables using SQL queries. These tables were then exported into Excel and saved in CSV format to ensure compatibility, accessibility, and ease of reuse for academic purposes.

The dataset captures essential bibliographic information including title of text, author, subject classification, language, publication details, and source references. It serves as a digital catalog that supports scholarly research, documentation, and preservation of Tijaniyya literature in Nigeria.
